# Cargoplane Client - Serverless publish/subscribe for webapps and AWS

Cargoplane is a toolset to help you quickly _transport message cargo_ between webapp clients and a backend running in the AWS cloud.

__Full documentation is published [online](https://docs.onica.com/projects/cargoplane).__

Cargoplane is written in Typescript, but transpiled to Javascript.
The client code is ES5, and so will work in any remotely modern browser.

This project is developed and maintained by the [Onica](https://www.onica.com) Cloud Native Development Practice.
