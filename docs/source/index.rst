Why Cargoplane?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Onica's early OSS releases have had aviation themed names;
this may or may not have something to do with the CTO being a pilot. Nobody really knows.

Cargoplane is visualized as a means to transport (fly) cargo (information) from one point to another.
There isn't much more to it than that.

Also, the name was available.
